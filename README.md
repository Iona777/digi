The following NuGet packages are used in the helper classes: 
EPPlus by Jan Kallman for Excel Read/Write
CsvHelper by Josh Close for CSV Read/Write (although I think it only worked for the write)
ExcelDataReader by ExcelDataReader developers (although not sure if I actually used this)
ExtentReports by AdventStack for reporting and logging
Newtonsoft.Json by James Newton-King for serialisation/deserialisation of Json files (not sure if this got used in the end)
